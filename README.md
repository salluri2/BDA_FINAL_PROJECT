# Communication Plan
We plan to communicate via Whatsapp, email and slack and conduct weekly meetings on Saturday on Google meet.

# Meeting Notes

We communicated about the dataset by going over many datasets in the AWS registry, finalized the dataset and also discussed the business problem this dataset solves, further discussed the Machine learning models we can implement using this dataset.


# Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge

Data of trips taken by taxis and for-hire vehicles in New York City. Managed by the City of New York Taxi and Limousine Commission. The dataset contains information about pick-up and drop-off dates, pick-up and drop-off times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip lengths, itemized rates, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts according to driver reports. The data used in the associated datasets were gathered and submitted to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission by technology companies approved under the Taxicab and Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).

After analyzing the dataset we have found that the data needs to be preprocessed to address the business problem. Also according to the authors who published the dataset, it was mentioned that the TLC presents statistics from base trip records as given by the bases, and we cannot guarantee or validate their correctness or completeness. As a result, this figure may not represent the entire number of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases. The TLC conducts periodic records reviews and, where appropriate, takes enforcement measures to guarantee complete and correct information.


#  Selection of relevant data

The data has been selected from the registry of open data from AWS, which is in the link provided to us which is the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data.
The link to the dataset is attached here: https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/

# Research Objectives and Question(s)

Using the data set we plan to pre-process the data and use it, to meet our specific goals by analyzing and finding any patterns in the given dataset.
Use the Machine learning model on this dataset to do a predictive analysis task. we plan on choosing regression models on the given dataset and visualising using different kinds of graphs to understand the trends in a better way.
