Data of trips taken by taxis and for-hire vehicles in New York City. Managed by City of New York Taxi and Limousine Commission. The dataset contains information about  pick-up and drop-off dates, pick-up and drop-off times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip lengths, itemized rates, rate types, payment type, and passenger counts according to driver reports. The data used in the associated datasets was gathered and submitted to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission by technology companies approved under the Taxicab and Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).

Note: The TLC presents statistics from base trip records as given by the bases, and we cannot guarantee or validate their correctness or completeness. As a result, this figure may not represent the entire number of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases. The TLC conducts periodic records reviews and, where appropriate, takes enforcement measures to guarantee complete and correct information.
